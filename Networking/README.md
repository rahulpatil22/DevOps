1.Understand OSI & TCP/IP Models
Learn about the OSI and TCP/IP models, including their layers and purposes.
Task: Write examples of how each layer applies to real-world scenarios (e.g., HTTP at the Application Layer, TCP at the Transport Layer).
=>
OSI Model (7 Layers) – With Real-World Examples

1️⃣ Application Layer (Layer 7)
What it does: Provides services to end-users (browser, apps, email).
Real-world examples:
HTTP/HTTPS → Browsing websites (Chrome, Firefox)
SMTP → Sending emails (Gmail, Outlook)
DNS → Converting google.com to IP address
FTP/SFTP → Uploading files to servers
2️⃣ Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
What it does: Data formatting, encryption, compression.
Real-world examples:
TLS/SSL encryption → Secure websites (https://)
JPEG, PNG → Image formats
MP3, MP4 → Audio/video compression
JSON/XML → Data formatting for APIs
3️⃣ Session Layer (Layer 5)
What it does: Opens, manages, and ends sessions between systems.
Real-world examples:
Login sessions to websites
API session tokens
Keeping connection alive while uploading a large file
Remote desktop sessions
4️⃣ Transport Layer (Layer 4)
What it does: Ensures reliable or fast data transfer between apps.
Protocols & examples:
✔ TCP (reliable, connection-oriented)
Email sending
Browser page loading
File transfer
WhatsApp message delivery guarantee
✔ UDP (fast, no delivery guarantee)
Video streaming (YouTube)
Online gaming
Live cricket/football streaming
VoIP calls
5️⃣ Network Layer (Layer 3)
What it does: Routing packets across networks.
Real-world examples:
IP addressing (IPv4/IPv6)
Routers forwarding your data
Traceroute showing hops
VPNs changing your IP
6️⃣ Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
What it does: MAC addressing and communication between devices in same network.
Real-world examples:
Switches working with MAC addresses
ARP converting IP → MAC
WiFi (802.11) frame handling
Ethernet communication
7️⃣ Physical Layer (Layer 1)
What it does: Actual bits over physical media.
Examples:
Fiber optic cables
Ethernet cables
WiFi radio waves
Network interface cards
Electrical signals

1️⃣ Application Layer
(Combines OSI Layers 5, 6, 7)
Examples:
HTTP / HTTPS
DNS
SMTP, POP3
DHCP
SSH
2️⃣ Transport Layer
Same as OSI’s Layer 4.
Examples:
✔ TCP → Web browsing, email, file transfers
✔ UDP → Gaming, video streaming, calls
3️⃣ Internet Layer
(Equivalent to OSI Network Layer)
Examples:
IP addressing
Routing
ICMP (ping)
NAT
4️⃣ Network Access Layer
(Combines OSI Layers 1 & 2)
Examples:
Ethernet
WiFi (802.11)

2.Protocols and Ports for DevOps
Study the most commonly used protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, DNS) and their port numbers.
Task: Create a blog, article, GitHub page, or README listing these protocols and explaining their relevance to DevOps workflows
=>
